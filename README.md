## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

1.	My name is Michelle Leather and my waketech address is mleather@my.waketech.edu
2.	I created it a little while ago to work on CS50 work, but I haven't done much with it yet.
3.	I creased a repository by clicking on the plus sign, selecting new repository, and inputting my username as the title and making it a README file.
4.	To clone the repository on my laptop, I had to download GitHub desktop version and click the upper left "clone repository" button. Then I selected which repository I wanted to clone.
