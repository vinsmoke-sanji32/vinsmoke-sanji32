## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

1.	My name is Michelle Leather and my waketech address is mleather@my.waketech.edu
2.	I created it a little while ago to work on CS50 work, but I haven't done much with it yet.
3.	I creased a repository by clicking on the plus sign, selecting new repository, and inputting my username as the title and making it a README file.
4.	To clone the repository on my laptop, I had to download GitHub desktop version and click the upper left "clone repository" button. Then I selected which repository I wanted to clone.

## Recommended websites
1. Internet Archive [[https://archive.org/]]\
Please donate to the internet archive btw, it is a gem that digitizes media that may have otherwise been lost or deteriorated with time. Unfortunately, corporate interests (greed) has led to many lawsuits against them, however, it is a critical resource to protect for archival and freedom of information purposes.
2. LibreTexts [[https://libretexts.org/]]\
Access to thousands of free textbooks on a multitude of topics (you can even download them for offline use).
